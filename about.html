                   <h3> A Little About Me</h3>
               <p> I'm currently enrolled in my second year of college at <a href="https://www.nwmissouri.edu">Northwest Missouri State University</a> as an IDM: New Media major.</p>
                   <p>I've grown up in Maryville Missouri my entire life and have one brother. </p>
                   <p> I make Youtube videos on the side when I have time and know my way around software like Adobe Premiere Pro because of it. </p>
                   <p> I play a lot of Super Smash Bros and go to tournaments for the game often, as well as being top 3 on my campus.</p>
